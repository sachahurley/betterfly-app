# BetterFly Product Brief

## Project Overview / Description

BetterFly is a gamified wellness application that combines an engaging onboarding experience with a 5-day challenge system to help users build healthy habits. The app features a Duolingo-inspired onboarding flow where users provide health preferences and complete the first day of their wellness challenge simultaneously. Upon completion, users enter a dashboard experience that tracks progress, manages preferences, and rewards achievements through a virtual currency system.
